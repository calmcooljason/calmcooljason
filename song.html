    <h3>song reading and writing</h3> 
    <p3>song reading and writing has to the second most time consumeing hobby next to gaming since i am kind of a perfectionist as if the bas aint right or the note is not at the right tone i will do everything in my power to fix it. i also spend a lot of my time listening to music as that is how i make time go faster since the days of school are boring and long for no reason.<p3>
      <h3>music i listen to on my free time</h3>
   <p3>the music i listen to is heavily rap and R.&.B oriented my favorite artist of all time to listen to is:
<li>tyler,the creator<lo>
  <li>childish gambino<lo>
    <li>and kid cudi<lo></p3>
    
      <p3>they all have unigue rap patterns beats and punch lines i like to analyze and try to be as great as them or even better. there is a common theme with all these artist they all look up to kanye west. kid cudi being a product from kanye's album "808's and heartbreak" which so happens to be my favorite kanye album
