     <h5>spending time with friends and family</h5>  
    
    <p6>family and friends are extremly important to me as they are the people that keep happy and entertained. i often am  never seen by myself i allways have a really good friend by my side, hanging with my sibling, or spending time with other family members. me and my friends play alot of games together like borderlands or call of duty. i play games with my sister but we only play minecraft. i play some games with my parents like mario with my mom and devil may cry with my dad, but me and parents favorite thing to do is workout together and play pokemon since we all are massive nerds. </p6>
