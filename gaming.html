    <h2>video games</h2>
      <P2>My favorite gaming genre is looter shooters. wich consist of three major games: 
      <li>destiny 1 & 2<Lo>
        <li>borderlands 1 & 2 (yes their is a pre sequal but it is heavily hated by the community)<lo>
          <li>fallout</lo><p2>
            <p7>, but battle royal game has started major contrivorsy for games like fortnite & P.U.B.G because you loot and you shoot but they kinda branch off into their own catagory of last one standing. i do play plenty of different games that range from mario to call of duty but thats just my favorite gaming genre<p7>
